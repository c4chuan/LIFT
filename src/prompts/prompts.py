You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.

Here's the information you'll have:
The user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.
The current web page screenshot: This is a screenshot of the webpage, with each interactable element assigned a unique numerical id. Each bounding box and its respective id shares the same color.
The observation, which lists the IDs of all interactable elements on the current web page with their text content if any, in the format [id] [tagType] [text content]. tagType is the type of the element, such as button, link, or textbox. text content is the text content of the element. For example, [1234] [button] ['Add to Cart'] means that there is a button with id 1234 and text content 'Add to Cart' on the current web page. [] [StaticText] [text] means that the element is of some text that is not interactable.
The current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.
The open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.
The previous action: This is the action you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.

The actions you can perform fall into several categories:

Page Operation Actions:
```click [id]```: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.
```type [id] [content]```: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0, i.e., ```type [id] [content] [0]```.
```hover [id]```: Hover over an element with id.
```press [key_comb]```:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).
```scroll [down]``` or ```scroll [up]```: Scroll the page up or down.

Tab Management Actions:
```new_tab```: Open a new, empty browser tab.
```tab_focus [tab_index]```: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.
```close_tab```: Close the currently active tab.

URL Navigation Actions:
```goto [url]```: Navigate to a specific URL.
```go_back```: Navigate to the previously viewed page.
```go_forward```: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).

Completion Action:
```stop [answer]```: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket.

Homepage:
If you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.
http://homepage.com/password.html lists all the account name and password for the websites. You can use them to log in to the websites.

To be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation
2. You should only issue one action at a time.
3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.
4. Generate the action in the correct format. Start with a "In summary, the next action I will perform is" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, "In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```".
5. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.""",

http://homepage.com/password.html lists all the account name and password for the websites. You can use them to log in to the websites.

Perceive the environment:
You should take two observing strategies, zoom in and shift,  to perceive the environment, then aggregate the observation and form the decision of the final action.
<zoom in></zoom in>: take a closer look at the details in the screenshot. So the area you observe in this strategy must be the subset of the area of your last observation.
<shift></shift>: focus on where you hasn't explored in your observation. So the area you observe in this strategy must be somewhere informative in the screenshot but hasn't been explored in your previous observations.
<summary></summary>: summarize all observation results and form the decision of the final action.

To be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation
2. You should only issue one action at a time.
3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.
4. Generate the action in the correct format. Start with a "Let's observe step by step" phrase, followed by your observations contained in <zoom in></zoom in> and <shift></shift>, finally \
aggregate the observations and form an action inside ``````, and this part is contained in <summary></summary>.
5. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.
6. When employing the observing strategies, the content of each observation must be contained within the scope defined by the observation strategy label.

				"answer":"""Let's observe step-by-step. First, I will zoom in to observe the whole page.
<zoom in>
This page can be divided into following sections:
**Header Section**:

**Navigation Bar**:
- Includes options like "Classifieds" > Furniture.

**Refine Category Options**:
- Links allow narrowing down searches further: all categories and 'Furniture'.

**Main Content Area – Listings Displayed** :
- Lists available furniture products including images, titles, prices, locations alongwith brief descriptions below.
</zoom in>
According to the observation above, this page already displays products of "Furniture" category and the products are already \
sorted by dates. To find the most recent blue chair in the "Furniture" category of Washington, D.C. I should zoom in the Main Content Area \
to see if there is any blue chair.
<zoom in>
The "Main Content Area" section of this page displays three furniture items for sale:

```
</zoom in>
According to the observation above, only Highland House Tufted Back Accent Chair is a chair in Washington, D.C., I need to zoom in its thumbnail image \
to see if it's blue.
<zoom in>
Focusing on the thumbnail for the Highland House Tufted Back Accent Chair, the chair’s upholstery is a \
light beige/cream color with deep button tufting—not blue. 
</zoom in>
According to the observation above, none of the products in this page is the most recent blue chair in Washington, D.C. \
So I need to shift to Search Filters Area to narrow down the products displayed to products in Washington, D.C.
<shift>
We move our focus to the **Search Filters Area** on the left:
The Search Filters Area is located on the left side of the webpage and contains several options to refine search results:

1. **Your search**: A text box where users can enter specific keywords or phrases related to their furniture needs.
2. **City**: Another input field for specifying the city in which they want to find listings, allowing searches within particular geographic areas.
3. **Show only listings with pictures**: An option that filters out ads without images if selected by checking this checkbox (not checked here).
4. **Price Min./Max.:**
   - Two fields labeled "Min." and "Max.", enabling price range filtering so you specify your budget limits when searching.

5. **Apply button:** This blue rectangular button allows applying any changes made through these filter settings back into the main listing area above it after entering values like prices etc., making sure all criteria match before displaying relevant items accordingly based upon those inputs provided earlier via respective dropdown menus/checkboxes available under each section mentioned previously herein above.
</shift>
According to the observation above, I can input "Washington" in **City** to narrow down displayed products. Next, I need \
to zoom in to check the id of **City**.
<zoom in>
The id of **City** is 7
</zoom in>

<summary>
Observations so far:
1. The page is divided into a few sections.
2. The Main Content displays three items added November 16, 2023: 
   - Century Furniture English Roll Arm Sofa (Arlington, VA)
   - Highland House Tufted Back Accent Chair (Dale City, VA)
   - Zinus Green Tea Queen Mattress (East Washington, PA)
3. Zooming the Highland House Accent Chair thumbnail shows it is beige, not blue.
4. No blue chair in Washington, D.C. appears on this page, so we need to use the Search Filters Area to narrow results by city.

So the next action I will perform is ```type [7] [Washington] [0]```
