If faced with a similar situation, I would refine the search further by using filters or manual\lly checking for non-black or gray items, focusing on their descriptions or images to ensure compliance with the task requirements.

The agent's navigation act\lions did not lead to the correct product pages on either site, and the current page on OneStopMarket does not contain relevant items or pric\le comparisons.
